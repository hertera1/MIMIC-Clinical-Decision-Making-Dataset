## Overview

This repository contains the code to create the MIMIC Clinical Decision Making (MIMIC-CDM) Dataset.

Visit https://huggingface.co/spaces/MIMIC-CDM/leaderboard to check out the current leaderboard. I will update this as new models are released. If you would like a model to be tested and put on the board, please write me an email at paul (dot) hager (at) tum (dot) de.


## Environment

To setup the environment, create a new virtual environment of your choosing with python=3.10 and then run:

```
pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt
```


## Option 1: Generate the dataset from MIMIC-IV-Ext-CDM directly

The most straightforward way of using the data is by downloading it from https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-ext-cdm/ and then converting it to the necessary format. To convert it, first set the `base_new` variable at the top of [ConvertPhysionet.py](ConvertPhysionet.py) to the folder containing the downloaded MIMIC-IV-Ext-CDM dataset. Then run:

```python ConvertPhysionet.py```

## Option 2: Generate the dataset from scratch from MIMIC-IV v2.2 

The more laborious and time-intensive way of creating the dataset is from the raw MIMIC-IV v2.2 download. First download the necessary hospital data from https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/ and the necessary text data from https://www.physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-note/2.2/.  Then set the following two path variables in [CreateDataset.py](CreateDataset.py):

1. `base_mimic` should be set to the parent folder of your MIMIC-IV download. This folder should contain the [hosp](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/) and [note](https://www.physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-note/2.2/) folders.
2. `base_new` should be set to a folder where the generated files will be saved.

Then run:
   
```python CreateDataset.py```
